# -Vanilla-to-do-app
An oldie but goldie, with some extra features


This is my very first attempt at a "complex" project. The base idea was a classic, bare-bones "To-do" app in vanilla html5/css/javascript. I achieved this and I decided to add more stuff to it until I got bored or it got too complicated to edit. So far it has the following features:

1. The ability to add a task by inputting text in a input text field, turning it into a list item. A lilttle style is added (icon, bg color) and it gets displayed at the bottom of the page.
2. The ability to add multiple tasks at once by inputting text in a textarea. The entire text is split by "," and turned into a list item + all of the above. It has safeguards in place in order to prevent empty/whitespace fields from being added to the list. It sets the text to lowercase and capitalizes it before displaying.
3. Users have the ability to clear the entire list or the task that they mark as achieved.
4. There is also a functioning digital clock, the entire container serving as watch, timer and stopwatch. The "How it works" button provides a tutorial for all available features.

The project is responsive, however, as this is a training project it was only "disigned" to be responsive on 1920x1080 + max-width: 600px (average mobile device). The mobile version was not fully optimized but it is fully functional.
